AI Prompt Generator for Content Creation — Static Demo

What this is
- A minimal, self-contained static web app that generates detailed AI prompts for images and videos based on simple inputs.
- No backend required — all prompt generation logic runs in your browser.

Files
- `index.html` — main UI
- `assets/script.js` — prompt generation logic and presets
- `assets/styles.css` — minimal styling

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `Start > Run` and paste the file path).
2. Fill in the fields (Concept/Product, Style, Mood, Platform, Aspect Ratio, Output Type).
3. Click `Generate Prompt` to get a detailed prompt you can copy into image/video generators (MidJourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or video tools).

Examples
- Try: Concept = "luxury perfume bottle", Style = "cinematic product photography", Mood = "luxurious", Platform = "Instagram (Reels)", Output Type = "Image"

Notes
- This is a demo generator focusing on producing high-quality textual prompts. For production use, consider integrating a backend, authentication, saving presets, and exporting structured JSON or media generation API calls.
